************Internet of Things and Its Applications (M1-R5.1)**************************************
i. Write a program to Blink default Light Emitting Diode(LED) on Arduino board with the
delay of 2 sec.

ii. Write a program to interface LEDs on pin no. 10,11,12,13 and blink alternatively at the
delay of 1 sec.


iii. Write a program to run pattern(s) on LEDs connect at pins 10,11,12,13.
Pattern example:
 on, on, off, off
 off, on, on, off
 off, off, on, on
 on, off, off, off
 off, on off, off
 off, off, on, off
 off, off, off, on

iv. Write a program to interface buzzer with Arduino board to buzz on/off with the delay of
1sec.


v. Write a program to interface LED and Buzzer with Arduino board, so that buzzer is put on
whenever LED is on and Buzzer is put off when LED is off.


vi. Write a program to interface Button and LED, so that LED blinks/glow when button is
pressed.


vii. Write a program to interface Button, buzzer and LED, whenever the button is pressed the
buzzer gives beep for 100ms and LED status is toggled.

viii. Write a program to interface LEDs at pins 10,11,12,13 and buttons at pins 7,8.
 When first
time button at pin 7(increment button) is pressed first LED at pin 10 is switched on, when
second time button is pressed the next LED at 11 is switched on. Similarly, when the button
at pin 8 (decrement button) is pressed the LEDs are switched off sequentially.


ix. Write a program to interface LEDs at pins 10,11,12,13 and button at pins 7. The press of
button changes the pattern of LED glow. (considering four patterns of LED glow)

x. Write a program to interface Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and display the values read
on the Serial monitor after delay of 2 seconds each.

xi. Write a program to interface Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and LED with Arduino board.
Whenever there is sufficient light falls on LDR the LED is off and when there is dark around
LDR the LED is put on.

xii. Write a program to interface LEDs at any two PWM pins and exhibit LED fading.

xiii. Write a program to interface LED at PWM pin and LDR, in such a way that when the light
intensity falling on LDR rises the LED glow should be reduced and after a threshold value
the LED should be put off. (representing smart street light concept)


xiv. Write a program to interface LEDs at any two PWM pins and button, to exhibit LED fading
at the click of button

xv. Write a program to interface any analog (pollution) sensor and display the values read on
Serial monitor.


xvi. Write a program to interface LCD with Arduino board and display ‘Hello world’ on it .


xvii. Write a program to interface keypad with Arduino board and display the key pressed on
Serial monitor.

xviii. Write a program to interface LCD and keypad with Arduino board and display the key
pressed from keypad on LCD.

xix. Write a program to interface LCD and keypad (4 X 4) , to exhibit the functionality of a basic
calculator.

xx. Write a program using LCD, LEDs, Buzzer and keypad to simulate a password based
security lock system. User enters 4-digit password and if the password is correct buzzer and
Green LED is put on. But if the password is incorrect Red LED is put on. After three
incorrect attempts Red LED along with buzzer blinks continuously.

xxi. Write a program to interface LCD and DHT11, displaying the value read from sensor DHT
on LCD.


xxii. Write a program to interface DHT11 or any other temperature sensor, DC Motor, to exhibit
a real life situation that whenever temperature rises above a threshold value the DC motor
(representing fan) starts and when temperature falls below a value, the motor stops.

xxiii. Write a program to interface LCD and Bluetooth module, to exhibit the values received
from mobile handset via Bluetooth on LCD.

xxiv. Write a program to interface LED and Bluetooth module, to switch on the LED if 1 is passed
through Bluetooth and switch off the LED if 0 is send.

xxv. Write a program to interface Relay and Bluetooth module to switch on AC load (5W LED
bulb, table lamp, etc) connected to relay if 1 is passed through Bluetooth and switch off the
AC Load if 0 is send.
